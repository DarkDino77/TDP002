1. Create new complete deck with jokers (54).
2. Split deck and sort only two colors (28).
3. Shuffle deck.

4. Move joker A down one card.
5. Move joker B down two cards.
6. Split decks between jokers (A, B, C).
7. Reverse the order of splitted deck (C, B, A).
8. Check value of bottom-most card in deck.
   Move as many cards from top of deck to above it according to it's value.
9. Check value of top-most card in deck.
   Select the card that is placed from top-down according to value of top-most card.
   The card after selected card is key.
   If card is joker no key is selected.
10. Save key into sequence.
11. Repeat from step 4.

Value sequence:
Suite A = 0. Suite B = 13.
Ace = 1,
2 - 10,
Jack = 11,
Queen = 12,
King = 13.
Add Suite to card value.


Encrpyt message:
1. Strip all letters outside A-Z in message string.
   Convert non ASCII letters to ASCII compatible letters.
2. Convert message string to integer list.
   A = 1, B = 2, C = 3, [...], Z = 26
3. Convert key string to integer list.
4. Add key integer list to message integer list.
   If sum of both lists is greater than 26 remove 26.
5. Convert back to letters using same algorithm.
   A = 1, B = 2, C = 3, [...], Z = 26

Decrypt message:
1. Convert encrypted message string to integer list.
   A = 1, B = 2, C = 3, [...], Z = 26
2. Convert key string to integer list.
3. Subtract key integer list from encrypted integer list.
4. Convert decrypted integer list back to string.
